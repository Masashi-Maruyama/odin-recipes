      <h2>Description</h2>
      <p>
        The key to beef stew is red wine. Although the alcohol content is lost
        during the stewing process, it adds flavor and richness, giving the stew
        a much deeper taste.
      </p>
      <p>
        Cut vegetables such as potatoes and carrots into large chunks for a
        hearty, satisfying flavor that is perfect for the volume of beef!
